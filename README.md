nodechat
========
"nodechat" is a simple web-chat demonstration made with Node.JS, ExpressJS, Jade & Socket.IO. 

It's based on a tutorial found [here](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/real-time-chat-with-nodejs-socketio-and-expressjs--net-31708). Credit to Krasimir Tsonev for this tutorial!

"nodechat" will serve as a simple testbed for me to play with some of Node's features.
Larger projects that emanate from this will be extracted to individual repos as they mature.
